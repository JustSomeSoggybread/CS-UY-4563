    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll employ gradient ascent to determine weights for a logistic regression problem focused on diagnosing breast cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** is a widely-recognized collection of features manually recorded by physicians from fine needle aspiration samples. The primary objective is to determine whether the cells are benign or malignant based on these features. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset details:** [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sample from the dataset is derived from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These images are processed to extract characteristics of cell nuclei, which are instrumental in the diagnostic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of ten real-valued features that provide various measurements related to the cell nucleus:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Radius:** Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.\n",
    "2. **Texture:** Standard deviation of gray-scale values.\n",
    "3. **Perimeter**\n",
    "4. **Area**\n",
    "5. **Smoothness:** Local variation in radius lengths.\n",
    "6. **Compactness:** \\( \\frac{\\text{perimeter}^2}{\\text{area}} - 1.0 \\)\n",
    "7. **Concavity:** Severity of concave portions of the contour.\n",
    "8. **Concave Points:** Number of concave portions of the contour.\n",
    "9. **Symmetry**\n",
    "10. **Fractal Dimension:** \"Coastline approximation\" - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission is to use logistic regression on the provided features to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. Successfully doing so can greatly aid in early diagnosis, ultimately leading to saved lives.\n"

    "For this semester, the teaching staff of this course will be using Autograder to grade programming assignment. Here are three things we would like you to know before starting. `PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.` Otherwise, you might lose points on some questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you see any blocks containing statements like `grader.check(\"Qxx\")`, please `do not modify` them. You can add new cells to the notebook, but just make sure there is `no other cells` between the answer cells containing tag `# TODO Qxx` and grading cells like 'grader.check(\"Qxx\")`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If the instructions say that you are required to use certain names for output variables, please `follow the instructions`, and you are not supposed to change the names of any given variables. You can still create new variables, but don't forget to `assign the output variables to correct values`. If the `type` of a output variable is specified, make sure the type of the variable is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use print statements to print out results through out the notebook. However, if you have any `print statements within functions`, please make sure putting them `in comments` before you submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Please note for questions that require you to plot, please **_DO NOT MODIFY_** statements like `plt.show(block=False)`. Changing the statement would block the execution of autograder and you might lose points on that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Please `APPEND YOUR NYU NETID` to the name your submission (for example, name your submission as \"HW1_prog_abc12345.ipynb\" when you submit on Gradescope, and replace <abc1234> with your NYU NetID). \n",
